## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).




 Task :- 

  

 Please prepare a simple "Product" module for us to understand your skills. Product module's requirements are given below. 

    

Requirements: 

  

    We expect that product module will contain product's name, price, status, person's information who add the product and product's type (item/service). 
    We expect to see all product's previous record history. (This may be just in Model & Migration.) 
    We expect to see Product's add, edit, delete, show, and index methods. 
    We expect a capability to see the person who added the product and capability to see a product list that can be filtered as product name and person who added the product. 
    When new products added, you need to send an email to person who added the product. (Mail settings do not have to be adjusted. We just need to see the mail notification code.) 
    When we run the project, we expect at least 1 person, and 1 product has been registered as default. 
    We will NOT be expecting to see login, logout, user crud modules. Please keep your focus on the product module. (You are free to create a middleware that can create a random user when request triggered.) 
    We are NOT expecting to test a code. 
    We are NOT expecting for HTML/Blade Template code. This scenario must work on an API and works with JSON format. 

      
    Hints:-   

    Attention will be paid to the variable names and file structure. 
    The desired features will be checked for compliance with the best usage scenarios allowed by Laravel and PHP. 
    Focus will be on methods you will use regarding the performance and security of the module. 

 Note: You can use "Storage" to store records. 

    We want to log a record's all changes. To see these informationâ€™s Who changed, which field changed, when was this change made. It's enough to see for us what kind of Models and Migrations you create on the system. We want to see what kind of structure you did.  

     The product list's additional features. There should be a search bar to filter user who added the product, and it can be search as product name.
